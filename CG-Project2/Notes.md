# Notes

 - [X] Put the camera in an init file. This file creates a list of variables used by all project (maybe fixed)
 - [ ] The camera doesn't zoom
 - [ ] Shaders are not copied right in the IGEntity panel
 - [ ] Use material::NONE to check if the entity has a material
 - [ ] Apparently it doesn't send the model matrix to the shader I don't know why
